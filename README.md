2008-2010 HSV E1 (VE)
ClubSport R8’s unique-to-HSV 6.0 litre LS2 V8 now produces an even more exhilarating 307kW at 6000 rpm (from 297kW at 6000rpm) and 550Nm at 4400rpm (from 530Nm @ 4400rpm) thanks to a revised intake and exhaust system (including new smooth flowing ‘four-into-two-into-one’ tubular extractors) and a 24 month program to refine the engine calibrations. That not only makes ClubSport R8 (and its E Series stable-mates) the fastest HSV and one of the fastest sedans in the world, it also makes it a member of the ultra-elite ‘four second’ club.
